              "  'Text': 'Jul 07, 2020, 09:53PM IST\\n\\nSource: AP\\n\\nTomas Kapler knew nothing about ventilators - he\\'s an online business consultant, not an engineer or a medical technician. But when he saw that shortages of the vital machines had imperiled critically ill COVID-19 patients in northern Italy, he was moved to action. Working around the clock, he brought together a team of 30 Czechs to develop a fully functional ventilator - Corovent. And they did it in a matter of days. Kapler is a member of an informal group of volunteers formed by IT companies and experts who offered to help the state fight the pandemic. Ventilators had become a precious commodity. Their price was skyrocketing and so was demand that the traditional makers were unable to immediately meet. Components for the ventilators were also in critically short supply. So Kapler said he set out to \"make a ventilator from the parts that are used in common machines.\" A crowd-funding campaign ensured the necessary finances in just hours. Kapler approached Karel Roubik, professor of Biomedical Engineering at the Czech Technical University for help. He, in turn, assembled colleagues through Skype, while his post-graduate student tested the new design in their lab in Kladno, west of Prague. They had a working prototype in five days, something that would normally take a year. Roubik said their simple design makes the machine reliable, inexpensive, and easy to operate and mass produce. A group of volunteer pilots flew their planes to deliver anything needed. And then MICO, an energy and chemical company based in Trebic, 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Kladno, offered to do the manufacturing. Flights between the two places helped fine-tune the production line in a few weeks. With the certification for emergency use in the European Union approved, the ventilator was ready in April - but it was not needed in the Czech Republic, which had managed to contain the outbreak. MICO has submitted a request for approval for emergency use in the United States, Brazil, Russia and other countries. Meanwhile, they\\'ve applied for EU certification for common hospital use. Kapler looks back at the effort with satisfaction.',\n",

              "  'Text': 'Jul 07, 2020, 09:51PM IST\\n\\nSource: AP\\n\\nUS President Donald Trump blasted NASCAR for banning the Confederate flag and wrongly accused the sport\\'s only Black driver, Bubba Wallace, of perpetrating “a hoax” involving a rope shaped like a noose in his garage. Trump suggested Wallace should apologize after one of his crew members discovered the rope in a garage stall they had been assigned to. Federal authorities ruled last month that the rope had been hanging there since at least last October and was not a hate crime. Wallace has maintained the rope had been fashioned into a noose and has said he was saddened by “the despicable act of racism and hatred,\" and other Cup Series drivers rallied around him. “Has BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid, stood by his side, & were willing to sacrifice everything for him, only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX?\" Trump tweeted. \"That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president\\'s decision to wade into the Wallace case, saying that reporters were mischaracterizing the president\\'s tweet and were taking his comments about the Confederate flag out of context. \"The whole point of the tweet was to note the incident, the alleged hate crime that was not in fact a hate crime,\" she said. McEnany said the president \"rejects this notion that somehow NASCAR men and women, who go to these sporting events, are racists,\" and that the FBI report on the matter was an \"indictment of the media\\'s rush to judgment.\" Wallace, an Alabama native, has taken an active role in the push for racial equality. He has worn a shirt saying “I Can’t Breathe,\" raced with a Black Lives Matter paint scheme in Virginia and successfully lobbied for NASCAR\\'s Confederate flag ban. For more than 70 years, the flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. The series first tried to ban the Confederate flag five years ago but did nothing to enforce the order. While Trump claimed NASCAR\\'s ratings are down, they are actually up.',\n",

              "  'Text': 'WASHINGTON: TikTok , the wildly popular social media app known for its viral dance and lip sync clips, has been embraced by millions of students, celebrities and young adults across the United States. But the company’s ties to China could cripple its existence.\\n\\nTikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s long-simmering security and economic battle with Beijing. It is now desperately trying to convince lawmakers and administration officials that its allegiance lies with the United States, not China.\\n\\nThe social media company, which one year ago had virtually no lobbying presence in the nation’s capital, has hired a small army of more than 35 lobbyists to work on its behalf, including one with deep ties to President Donald Trump.\\n\\nBehind that buildup is a growing threat to one of TikTok’s most important markets. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has threatened to ban Chinese apps like TikTok, which are downloaded to mobile phones, over concerns they could be used for surveillance by the Chinese government . Peter Navarro, the White House trade adviser, called TikTok’s new chief executive an “American puppet” during a Fox Business interview Sunday and said the administration would take “strong action” against the company and other Chinese social media apps.\\n\\nA powerful US panel has opened a national security review into ByteDance’s 2018 purchase of Musical.ly, an app that was merged to form TikTok. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining whether the merged companies could give the Chinese government access to vast amounts of US data, including videos useful for training facial recognition software. And the Trump administration is weighing action against Chinese social media services like TikTok under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate international commerce in response to unusual and extraordinary threats, people familiar with the deliberations said.\\n\\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday evening, the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, said a number of administration officials were “looking at the national security risk as it relates to TikTok, WeChat and other apps.”\\n\\n“I don’t think there’s any self-imposed deadline for action, but I think we are looking at weeks, not months,” he said.\\n\\nIn the past three months, lobbyists working on behalf of TikTok have held at least 50 meetings with congressional staff and lawmakers, including those on top committees like commerce, judiciary and intelligence. Those meetings have included a slick presentation that includes an organizational chart showing TikTok does not operate in China and that most of its top leaders reside in the United States and are American citizens. For instance, TikTok’s new chief executive, Kevin Mayer, a former executive of Disney, lives in Los Angeles, they said.\\n\\nByteDance denies it shares data with the Chinese government and is distancing itself from its roots in the communist nation. The company stressed TikTok was not available in China — it offers a similar app called Douyin there instead — and said user data was stored in Virginia, with a backup in Singapore.\\n\\n“There’s a lot of misinformation about TikTok right now,” said Michael Beckerman, vice president and head of US Public Policy. “TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product and public policy in the US”\\n\\nBut some members of Congress still have suspicions. An aide to Sen Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who requested the CFIUS review of TikTok, said ByteDance had provided conflicting information in a meeting with representatives of Rubio’s office about where its data was stored as well as insufficient information about how it controls and censors its content.\\n\\n“It is no coincidence that every day more companies and organizations are asking employees to delete TikTok,” Rubio said in a statement, referring to moves by Wells Fargo and others to bar the app from company devices. “TikTok has yet to provide a real explanation to Americans about how they protect their data and how much of it could be made available to the Chinese Communist Party .”\\n\\nThe United States provides a crucial audience for TikTok. American influencers have global followings, and the app has become a center of conversation about politics, the pandemic and racial inequality. TikTok users claimed credit for reserving thousands of seats for Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma , last month — and then not showing up.\\n\\nBut it remains a high bar for ByteDance to convince the US government that it is not susceptible to the directives of the Chinese government. Trump and his top advisers have increasingly focused on Chinese technology companies, including Huawei and ZTE, saying those firms threaten national security by providing a conduit for the Chinese government to infiltrate US technology. The United States has already barred dozens of high-tech Chinese companies — including those specializing in supercomputers, artificial intelligence and facial recognition — from gaining access to US technology products out of national security concerns.\\n\\n“What the American people have to understand is, all the data that goes into those mobile apps that kids have so much fun with and seem so convenient, it goes right to servers in China, right to the Chinese military, the Chinese Communist Party and the agencies that want to steal our intellectual property,” Navarro said over the weekend.\\n\\nThe issue of whether TikTok should be curbed in the United States has taken on new urgency, in part because of India’s decision in late June to ban it and nearly 60 other Chinese apps, a Trump administration official said. TikTok has been downloaded 2 billion times, with its biggest markets in India, the United States and Brazil, according to SensorTower.\\n\\nIn December, the Pentagon ordered military personnel to delete the TikTok app from their phones, and some administration officials have argued that the United States should retroactively block ByteDance’s acquisition of Musical.ly, which could force the company to divest its US assets or at least make changes to the way it moves and stores data worldwide.\\n\\nThe State Department is considering expanding its so-called clean networks program to include apps as it tries to steer foreign governments away from unsecure Chinese telecommunications firms in the name of protecting Americans’ private information, according to officials familiar with the internal discussions.\\n\\nTikTok would be considered among those apps, although officials said the State Department has not yet designated companies to be included in the expansion.\\n\\n“Whether it’s TikTok or any of the other Chinese communications platforms, apps, infrastructure, this administration has taken seriously the requirement to protect the American people from having their information end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” Pompeo said Wednesday in an interview with The Hill newspaper in Washington.\\n\\nHe said he had heard from parents eager to see TikTok banned: “That’s for the parents to decide their kids’ usage on their cellphones. It’s our task to make sure that their children’s information doesn’t end up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.”\\n\\nOfficials have also been considering potential national security risks from other Chinese internet and social media services, including Tencent’s WeChat, which had more than 1 billion active monthly users worldwide in the first quarter of 2020.\\n\\n“These companies cannot claim that they don’t follow the orders of the party; that’s just not credible,” said Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who tracks Chinese investment worldwide. “Chinese firms don’t have a choice.”\\n\\n',\n",

Read More\\n\\nCOLOMBO: For months he\\'s been anonymous, but now Prasad Dinesh , linked by Sri Lankan authorities to nearly half of the country\\'s more than 2,600 coronavirus cases, is trying to clear his name, and shed some of the stigma of a heroin addiction at the root of his ordeal.Under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa , a former army lieutenant colonel credited with helping end Sri Lanka\\'s long civil war in 2009 with a brutal military campaign against separatists, the Indian Ocean island nation has used the armed forces to combat the virus.When Rajapaksa was elected president last year, a health unit was created in the intelligence service that sprang into action when COVID-19 first appeared, according to State Intelligence Service Assistant Director Parakrama de Silva. Intelligence officers, health workers, police officers and military troops have worked together to identify infected people, trace their contacts and send them to military-run quarantine centers.After Dinesh, 33, tested positive for the virus in April, navy sailors raided his village, forcing his contacts into quarantine. But authorities have blamed a melee that ensued not on the military, but on Dinesh and said the rumpus ended up leading to at least 1,100 additional virus infections.These cases, they publicly declared, were all linked linked to a single patient.Referring to him only as \"Patient 206,\\'\\' government officials lambasted Dinesh on TV and social media, blaming him for at least three clusters of cases, including about 900 navy sailors who were infected after an operation in Ja-Ela, a small town about 19 kilometers (12 miles) north of the capital, Colombo.Dinesh, however, says his drug addiction, which is considered a crime in Sri Lanka, makes him a convenient scapegoat.``I can\\'t accept that I am responsible for infecting so many, including the navy sailors,\\'\\' Dinesh told The Associated Press, after he had returned home following his release from a monthlong stay at a hospital.Before the pandemic reached Sri Lanka, resulting in an island-wide lockdown, Dinesh worked as an auto rickshaw driver. But now he\\'s unable to find work.``No one gives a job when they realize that I am Patient 206,\\'\\' he said.Likening him to South Korea\\'s ``Patient 31,\\'\\' whom media in that country labeled a ``super spreader\\'\\' because she was the first person to test positive in a secretive church community where the virus was later found endemic, police spokesman Ajith Rohana said Dinesh had undermined Sri Lanka\\'s fight against COVID-19.``He is the turning point and has done huge damage to our country,\\'\\' Rohana said.Authorities say that on April 5, Dinesh was caught by village residents for a robbery and handed over to police. At the station, Dinesh had a fever as well as a leg injury sustained during the robbery, so authorities admitted him to a nearby hospital, where he tested positive for the coronavirus and stayed for 31 days.Dinesh hasn\\'t contested charges that he and others broke into a house in a nearby village to take coconuts they could sell in order to buy heroin.After he tested positive, the police who made the arrest, Dinesh\\'s friends and more than 100 people in his neighborhood were ordered to quarantine at home.But not everyone complied.Afraid that the virus would spread quickly in the congested area, Sri Lanka\\'s navy sent in a team of sailors to help health workers. As the sailors approached, some of Dinesh\\'s associates panicked.``They were climbing trees, they were trying to jump over a fence, trying to have a bath, trying to jump into a canal,\\'\\' Adm. Jayanath Colombage , a former navy commander and member of the national task force to combat the virus, said in a TV interview.Of the 28 people seized from the community and quarantined, 16 tested positive. Two weeks later, some sailors involved in the operation did, too.Navy spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Isuru Suriyabandara defended the navy, saying it had deployed well-trained troops with protective gear who were quarantined for 21 days after the operation.The first infected sailor, who was on leave in the town of Polonnaruwa, about 225 kilometers (140 miles) northeast of Colombo, was reported April 22, prompting provincial health officials to isolate 12 nearby villages.The next day, 30 other sailors tested positive.With the virus spreading to different parts of the country where sailors were on leave, authorities ordered troops from all arms of the military to report back to their camps.Some 4,000 navy sailors were quarantined inside a single camp, while more than 200 relatives were taken to navy-run quarantine centers. At least 15 villages were isolated in different parts of Sri Lanka for about two weeks, and about 1,300 other people underwent self-quarantine.Ultimately, about 900 navy sailors tested positive, with around 50 other infected people also part of that cluster. Two other clusters also blamed on Dinesh had at least 150 coronavirus cases, according to authorities.Sri Lanka has confirmed at least 2,665 cases in all, including 11 deaths, meaning nearly half of its caseload has been blamed on one man - Dinesh.\"What to do? It is our fault for using drugs?\" he said, referring to his heroin habit.Dinesh said that he had been using heroin since 2002, but that he never became \"a severe addict.\" During the coronavirus lockdown, however, he used the drug more regularly, and joined three other users in the robbery to raise money to buy more heroin.Former Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena launched an expansive crackdown on illegal drugs, calling users \" social catastrophe,\" and his successor, Rajapaksa, also has taken a tough stance.Authorities have used the fallout from the raid on Dinesh\\'s village to increase anti-drug crackdowns in slums and urban apartments.Officials say some 300,000 people - around 1.5% of all Sri Lankans - are addicted to drugs.Dinesh, however, said he was no longer part of that stigmatized population.One positive of being infected with the coronavirus, he said, was that his hospitalization helped him to kick his heroin habit.He said he had body pains for about two days. \"I did not suffer severe withdrawals because I was not a severe addict,\" he said.\"I have now completely given up (drugs),\" he said. \"I don\\'t even smoke a cigarette. I am always with my two kids now and play with them. I feel good.\"',\n",

              "  'Text': 'BEIJING: In the global race to make a coronavirus vaccine , a state-owned Chinese company is boasting that its employees, including top executives, received experimental shots even before the government approved testing in people.\"Giving a helping hand in forging the sword of victory,\\'\\' reads an online post from SinoPharm with pictures of workers it says helped \"pre-test\" its vaccine.Whether it\\'s viewed as heroic sacrifice or a violation of international ethical norms, the claim underscores the enormous stakes as China competes with US and British companies to be the first with a vaccine to help end the pandemic - a feat that would be both a scientific and political triumph.\"Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is the new Holy Grail,\\'\\' said Lawrence Gostin, a global public health law expert at Georgetown University. \"The political competition to be the first is no less consequential than the race for the moon between the United States and Russia.\"China has positioned itself to be a strong contender. Eight of the nearly two dozen potential vaccines in various stages of human testing worldwide are from China, the most of any country. And SinoPharm and another Chinese company already have announced they\\'re entering final testing.Both China and SinoPharm have invested heavily in a tried-and-true technology - an \"inactivated\" vaccine made by growing the whole virus in a lab and then killing it, which is how polio shots are made. Leading Western competitors use newer, less proven technology to target the \"spike\" protein that coats the virus.That protein is \"a good place to make our bet,\" Dr. Gary Nabel, chief scientific officer of the French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, said at a US biotechnology industry meeting. But \"it\\'s good to have some diversity. I like the fact that there is an inactivated, whole vaccine. That provides an alternative in case one of these should fail.\"SinoPharm\\'s claim that 30 \"special volunteers\" rolled up their sleeves even before the company got permission for its initial human study raises ethical concerns among Western observers. The company\\'s post cites a \"spirit of sacrifice\" and shows seven men in suits and ties - a mix of scientists, businessmen and one Communist Party official with a background in military propaganda.\"The idea of people willing to sacrifice themselves ... is pretty much expected in China,\\'\\' said Yanzhong Huang, a global health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. nonprofit organization.But with corporate and government officials getting vaccinated, other employees ``might feel pressure to participate. That would violate the voluntary principle\\'\\' that is a bedrock of modern medical ethics, Huang said.The first round of human testing - a Phase 1 trial - requires permission from a country\\'s drug regulators, who decide whether there is enough laboratory and animal evidence to justify the attempt.SinoPharm, which declined to comment for this story, is testing two vaccine candidates that received government permission for Phase 1 trials in mid- to late April. In a post on its subsidiary\\'s official WeChat account, the company says it conducted its \"pre-test\" at the end of March ``to make the vaccines hit the market as early as possible.\\'\\'It would not be the only shortcut China is taking. In late June, the government gave special approval for the military to use an experimental vaccine made by another company, CanSino Biologics, skipping the final testing needed to prove if it really works. CanSino now says it\\'s in talks with four other countries about doing that research.Some participants in the first CanSino clinical trial in March said in social media posts that researchers on the project claimed they had been injected Feb. 29, before regulators gave the study the go-ahead. A researcher said team leader Chen Wei, a renowned military virologist, was the first to receive the experimental vaccine, one of the participants told state-owned Beijing News.CanSino and Chen\\'s Academy of Military Medical Sciences turned down requests for information and interviews. The National Medical Products Administration, which approves vaccine trials, also declined to comment.In May, a Russian scientist told the RIA Novosti news agency that he and fellow researchers also had vaccinated themselves ahead of approved studies. ``It\\'s self-defense in order for us to continue working\\'\\' on a vaccine, said Alexander Gintsburg of the Moscow-based Gamaleya research institute.``Everyone is alive and well and cheerful,\\'\\' he added.Russia\\'s Association of Clinical Research Organizations condemned the action as a ``crude violation of the very foundations of clinical research, Russian law and universally accepted international regulations.\\'\\' But about a month later, Russia launched its first vaccine study, using the Gamaleya product.Examples of scientists experimenting on themselves abound in medical history.Around 1900, Pierre Curie, Marie Curie\\'s husband, deliberately burned his arm with radium as part of their radiation experiments. In the 1950s, Jonas Salk tested his ultimately successful polio vaccine on himself and his family. In the 1980s, Australia\\'s Dr. Barry Marshall drank a bacteria-laden broth as part of his quest to prove germs, not stress, cause stomach ulcers. He was right.And in China in the 1970s, a researcher named Tu Youyou, working in a secret military program, discovered an important anti-malaria drug that she first tested on herself. In 2015, she won a Nobel Prize.With a COVID-19 vaccine, national pride is at stake. President Xi Jinping pledged that any Chinese-made vaccine would be a ``global public good.\\'\\'All this is taking place as China strives to overcome years of drug scandals - the latest coming in 2018 when authorities recalled a rabies vaccine and later announced batches of children\\'s DPT vaccines, for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus, were ineffective.Giving the experimental shot early to SinoPharm\\'s employees ``sends a signal to the Chinese people, `You guys should not worry about the safety of the vaccine,\\'\\'\\' Huang said.Scientists vehemently debate self-experimenting because what happens to one or a few people outside of a well-designed study is anecdote, not evidence. More than 600,000 U.S. schoolchildren had to be given Salk\\'s vaccine or a dummy shot to prove polio protection. It took almost another decade to validate Marshall\\'s ulcer germ theory, which earned him a Nobel as well.Modern international ethics rules require participants in medical research to be fully informed and to freely consent. In the U.S., studies involving people must receive approval from an ``investigational review board,`` and most U.S. research institutions explicitly state there is no exception to board approval for self-experimenting.``Employees may not be the best volunteers because employees are in a relationship which is not equal,\\'\\' said Dr. Derrick Au, bioethics director at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Still, he said questions about China\\'s medical ethics might disappear if one of its COVID-19 vaccines ultimately proves to work. ``It\\'s difficult to argue against success,`` Au said.William Lee of the Milken Institute, a think tank in Santa Monica, California, that is tracking COVID-19 vaccine progress, said that because of China\\'s past scandals, ``if they are successful as being the first with a workable product on the market, it had better be so pristine, so pure that people who are outside of China would be willing to buy into it.``',\n",

Gatherings should be avoided while prayers should be offered at home,\" she added.Dr Shariq Lankar, a general practitioner, said as there was no vaccine or medicine available to cure the coronovirus infection,Â minimizing social contact and following other SOPs were key in this fight.\"Countries have prevented the spread of this disease by imposing lockdown and observing social distancing. We appeal to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters to reduce social contacts and take precautions as we are in a critical phase of the pandemic.

We worked around the clock, performing multiple transplants on non-Covid patients before accepting new lungs for this Covid-19 survivor,\" said Dr Ankit Bharat, chief of thoracic surgery and surgical director of the Northwestern Medicine Lung Transplant Programme, who performed seven lung transplants in seven days.\"Performing back to back lung transplants on such complex patients is demanding work and I\\'m extremely proud of our team\\'s dedication. It\\'s a testament to the infrastructure and expertise of Northwestern Medicine\\'s Lung Transplant Programme,\" the Meerut-born doctor said.The patient contracted Covid-19 in late March and received the majority of his treatment at another health system before being transferred to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for consideration of a double-lung transplant.Within 72 hours of being listed, the life-saving procedure was performed on July 4.Before the patient\\'s name was added to the transplant wait-list, he had to test negative for Covid-19.\"Coincidentally, the transplant happened to be on the 100th day of ECMO support. Being on ECMO and separated from the ventilator allowed the patient to participate in daily bedside rehabilitation which is important for lung transplantation ,\" said Dr Bharat.Typically, a double-lung transplant takes 6 to 7 hours, but this surgery took about 10 hours due to lung necrosis and severe inflammation in the chest cavities resulting from Covid-19.\"Prior to his arrival at Northwestern Memorial, the patient developed an invasive infection which required a major chest surgery. This was going to make the double-lung transplant substantially more difficult,\" says Samuel Kim, MD, Northwestern Medicine thoracic surgeon, who assisted in the double-lung transplant alongside Dr Bharat.\"His lung damage was among the worst I\\'ve ever seen. When we opened the chest cavity there was a lot of evidence of infection; everything we touched or dissected started bleeding and one misstep could have led to catastrophic consequences.\"Northwestern surgeons led by Dr Bharat in June have performed what is believed to have been the first-known lung transplant on a Covid-19 patient in the US last month -- on a woman in her 20s.The surgeons performed their first on a woman in her 20s whose lungs showed irreversible damage from the virus.She became the first known Covid-19 patient in the United States to receive a double-lung transplant.\"Our first patient continues to recover at an optimal pace,\" says Rade Tomic , MD, a pulmonologist and medical director of the Lung Transplant Programme.\"Our second patient is already off the ventilator and is talking to his family. He\\'s grateful for the care he received from all the health care providers, including those at his original hospital, who helped him get to this point. We\\'re optimistic that both patients will make a full recovery and return to their daily lives.\"',\n",

              "  'Text': 'NEW YORK: Two renowned Indian-Americans who have contributed towards the efforts in mitigating the Covid-19 health crisis are among the 38 immigrants honoured by a prestigious American foundation ahead of US Independence Day commemoration this year.Pulitzer Prize-winning author and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee, and Professor of Economics at Harvard University Raj Chetty have been named by the Carnegie Corporation of New York as \\'2020 Great Immigrants\\' honourees, the Corporation said in a statement on Wednesday.Born in New Delhi, Mukherjee is a noted biologist, oncologist and the author of several acclaimed books, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning \\'The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer\\'.Since 2009, he has served on the faculty of Columbia University, where he is associate professor of medicine and a practising physician at New York-Presbyterian Hospital. In 2014, Mukherjee was awarded the Padma Shri , one of India\\'s highest civilian honours.The Carnegie Corporation said that during the Covid-19 pandemic, Mukherjee has used his \"gifts as a science communicator\" to educate the public about the virus through essays, in media interviews, at public forums, as well as through his social media accounts.Mukherjee has stressed the importance of following guidelines to social distance, wear masks and to self-isolate when necessary, it said.In May, he was selected by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to serve on a 15-member Blue-Ribbon Commission focusing on improving telehealth and broadband access in response to the Covid-19 health crisis.Raj Chetty, who was born in New Delhi, has been one of the youngest professors to be granted tenure in Harvard\\'s history.In addition to his position as the William A. Ackman Professor of Economics at Harvard University, Chetty directs Opportunity Insights, a research lab that aims to identify barriers to economic and social mobility and develop scalable policy solutions to overcome them, the Corporation said.He helped launch a resource to monitor the real-time economic impact of Covid-19 on people, businesses and communities across the United States. This tool enables policy makers to make evidence-based decisions that balance vital public health priorities with the economic needs of their communities, it said.\"Chetty is optimistic about the potential of big data to inform policy and revive the American dream for the next generation, including immigrants -- like his own family -- who have long pinned their hopes on its promise,\" the corporation said.\"For us and many immigrants, that\\'s what America\\'s all about. If you work hard, you can move up, you can do whatever you want. The sky\\'s the limit,” the Corporation quoted Chetty as telling the Harvard Gazette Every July 4, when America celebrates its Independence Day, the Carnegie Corporation honours the legacy of its founder Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish immigrant who rose from poverty to become a leading industrialist, by recognizing an eminent group of immigrants who have made notable contributions to the progress of the American society.In 2020, the corporation honours 38 naturalized citizens \"who have enriched and strengthened our nation and our democracy through their contributions and actions,\" it said.\"Great immigrants have come from different backgrounds and have pursued different worthwhile goals. But collectively, they have shared a desire to become citizens and have made our democratic society stronger. For all of their efforts, we salute them,\" president of Carnegie Corporation of New York Vartan Gregorian said.The corporation said a third of this year\\'s honorees are helping the global health crisis recovery efforts by serving as nurses and doctors, as well as scientists who are striving to find effective treatments and a vaccine for Covid-19.Clergy and community leaders who are providing food and vital services to those in need are also among those being honoured.Overall, the \\'2020 Great Immigrants\\' represent 35 countries of origin and a wide range of contributions to American life, from human rights and computer science to art, business, education, health care, journalism, music, politics, religion, research, and sports.The 2020 honorees, who join more than 600 outstanding immigrants honoured by the Corporation since 2006, are recognized with a full-page public service announcement in the New York Times and a social media tribute on the Fourth of July.',\n",
